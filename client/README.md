## Description

A full stack application that will help you make the best of your time by not having to waste it by standing in lines. This application uses a full stack MERN tools to provide a simple and interactive platform where club goers can preregister for their spot in line rather than having to arrive on site and having to wait in long queues.

## User Story
AS BUSINESS MANAGER/OWNER I am presented with a page requiring my login information
WHEN I log in I want to be able to input data into the app which will generate a Q-TIME for users
ALSO i want the ability to access the queue
SO I have the ability to remove unwanted guests from the queue

AS A USER I am presented with a home screen with a form requiring a name, email, phone number, and how many guests are in their party
THEN upon submission of the form, I am presented with a page that shows my Q-TIME, alongside the form details.
WHEN the Q-TIME reaches zero, the guest recieves a notification, telling them to proceed to the nightclub
